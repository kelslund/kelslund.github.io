Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Kelsey Lund and I am a graduate student at North Carolina State University. My work involvess tudying the origin of the heaviest elements in the universe through the rapid neutron capture process. This allows me to study the violent collisions of compact object mergers using a variety of computational tools. 

Feel free to take a look around to find out more about the exciting work I have been able to a part of during my graduate career. 

If you have questions or want to reach out, I can be reached at kalund [at] ncsu.edu.
