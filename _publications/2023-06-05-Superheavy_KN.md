<b>Abstract: </b>As LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA enters its fourth observing run, a new opportunity to search for electromagnetic
counterparts of compact object mergers will also begin. The light curves and spectra from the first “kilonova”
associated with a binary neutron star merger (NSM) suggests that these sites are hosts of the rapid neutron capture
(“r”) process. However, it is unknown just how robust elemental production can be in mergers. Identifying
signposts of the production of particular nuclei is critical for fully understanding merger-driven heavy-element
synthesis. In this study, we investigate the properties of very neutron-rich nuclei for which superheavy elements can be produced in NSMs and whether they can similarly imprint a unique signature on kilonova light-
curve evolution. A superheavy-element signature in kilonovae represents a route to establishing a lower limit on
heavy-element production in NSMs as well as possibly being the first evidence of superheavy-element synthesis in
nature.
